## :deciduous_tree: About me

Hello!

I am a DevOps engineer. On a daily basis, I work with end-to-end CI/CD pipeline, deployment automation, AWS, programming & scripts.

My current job includes ensuring automated & repeatable deployment on (hundreds of) mostly isolated devices along with their cloud servers, in a connection-limited & resource-scarce context.

### :star2: Teamwork & Service Improvement

- Working in close collaboration with Fullstack Team & Project Managers.
- I am passionate about improving the stack! Part of the job is to identity pain points on the current stack, and create a solution to improve it (then create new-but-better problems...)
- Presentation & Slides:
  - I love presentation & discussion!
  - Actually making a solution is one thing, but discussion & persuasion to better understand the problem & solution (and its impacts!) before taking actions are no less important!


## :muscle: Personal projects

I am spending some time on the following two projects:

- [My DevOps stack automated installation](https://github.com/lamvng/my-devops-tools): An automated solution to set up my workstation by installing all the technical stack quickly.
- [NodeJS from scratch](https://github.com/lamvng/nodejs-from-scratch): A part of my job includes deploying containerized NodeJS applications. I would love to actually learn the language to better read the source code & documentation.
